##### define the data structure
score = Score("Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water", 110) # 110 bpm
guitarPart = Part(OVERDRIVE_GUITAR, 0)
bassPart = Part(ELECTRIC_BASS, 1)
drumPart = Part(0, 9) # using MIDI channel 9 (percussion)
guitarPhrase1 = Phrase() # guitar opening melody
guitarPhrase2 = Phrase() # guitar opening melody an octave lower
bassPhrase = Phrase() # bass melody
drumPhrase = Phrase() # drum pattern

##### create musical data

bassPhrase.setStartTime(64.0) # start after two more repetitions
drumPhrase.setStartTime(32.0) # start after two more repetitions
##### combine musical material
